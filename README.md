===================
Randomly generated 3D maze navigation game.  Originally made for Ludem Dare 26, I'm attempting to fix some of the bugs that I had when I uploaded the game.

The game requires Unity Pro.  The score keeping has been moved from the lower-left corner to a RenderTexture that is placed on walls.  This is the only feature that requires Unity Pro.

Elevators have been fixed as well as a number of clipping bugs.  I wouldn't call this complete (high score for times would be nice for example), but this is certainly better than it was on first release.  There are a number of unused assets sitting in here as well; those could be removed at some point.

The web build can be played [on my public dropbox](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/105401308/cubey_web/cubey_web.html)
